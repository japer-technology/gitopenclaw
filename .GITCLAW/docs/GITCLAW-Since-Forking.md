- `lifecycle/` — `main.ts` and `preinstall.ts`
- `.github/workflows/agent.yml` — single workflow

## 🚀 Fork Changes (japer-technology/gitclaw)

### 1. Complete Restructure into `.GITCLAW/` Drop In Folder

The original `lifecycle/`, `.pi/`, `AGENTS.md`, `LICENSE`, and `banner.jpeg` were moved and reorganized into a self-contained `.GITCLAW/` directory:

- **`.GITCLAW/install/`** — New installer: `GITCLAW-INSTALLER.ts`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `GITCLAW-WORKFLOW-AGENT.yml`
- **`.GITCLAW/.pi/`** — Pi config preserved inside `.GITCLAW`
- **`.GITCLAW/build/`** — Build directory with README
- **`.GITCLAW/package.json`** — Dedicated package.json

### 2. Extensive Documentation (15+ new docs)

- `GITCLAW-QUICKSTART.md`, `GITCLAW-ENABLED.md`, `GITCLAW-NOT-INSTALLED.md`
- `docs/GITCLAW-The-Idea.md`, `GITCLAW-Roadmap.md`, `GITCLAW-Possibilities.md`
- `docs/GITCLAW-Interactive-Possibilities.md`, `GITCLAW-The-GitHub-Possibilities.md`
- `docs/GITCLAW-Communication-Channels.md`, `GITCLAW-Internal-Mechanics.md`, `GITCLAW-Loves-Pi.md`
- Pi-specific: `GITCLAW-Pi-Architecture.md`, `GITCLAW-Pi-Capabilities.md`, `GITCLAW-Pi-Configuration.md`, `GITCLAW-Pi-Personality.md`, `GITCLAW-Pi-Skills.md`

### 3. New GitHub Workflows

| `lifecycle/preinstall.ts` | Refactored into `.GITCLAW/install/GITCLAW-INSTALLER.ts` |

## 🔑 Key Takeaway

The fork transformed the original minimal 3-commit Pi agent scaffold into a **full-featured, self-contained `.GITCLAW/` drop in system** with its own installer workflow, extensive documentation, lifecycle management, state tracking, issue automation, and tests — all while keeping 0 commits behind upstream.
