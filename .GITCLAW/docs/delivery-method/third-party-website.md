# Third-Party Website

> A dedicated website (e.g., `gitclaw.dev`) that serves as a full-featured installation hub, management dashboard, and community center for gitclaw.

---

## Overview

The Third-Party Website delivery method goes beyond a simple installation portal. It is a fully hosted web application — running on a dedicated domain like `gitclaw.dev` — that provides a comprehensive experience: GitHub OAuth sign-in, repository browsing, visual configuration, one-click installation, a management dashboard for installed repos, analytics, community showcase, and documentation.

While the [GitHub Pages portal](./github-pages-self-service-portal.md) is a lightweight, static-site version of this idea, the third-party website is the full-featured evolution with server-side capabilities, database storage, and richer functionality.

---

## How It Works

### Step 1 — User Signs In with GitHub OAuth

1. User visits `gitclaw.dev`.
2. Clicks **"Sign in with GitHub"**.
3. GitHub OAuth flow authenticates the user and grants the site access to their repositories.
4. The site stores the OAuth token (encrypted) for ongoing use.

### Step 2 — Browse and Select Repositories

After sign-in, the site displays:

- A list of the user's repositories (personal and organizational).
- Status indicators showing which repos already have gitclaw installed.
- Search and filter capabilities.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your Repositories                        │
│                                           │
│  ✅ user/project-alpha    v1.2.0          │
│  ✅ user/project-beta     v1.1.0 ⚠️ update│
│  ⬜ user/project-gamma    Not installed    │
│  ⬜ org/shared-lib        Not installed    │
│                                           │
│  [Install on selected]                    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 3 — Configure

For each selected repository, the user configures gitclaw:

- LLM provider and model.
- Thinking mode and token limits.
- Agent personality and custom system prompts.
- Workflow triggers and behavior.

The configuration UI provides real-time validation and live previews.

### Step 4 — Install

The user clicks **"Install"** and the site:

1. Creates a branch in the target repository via the GitHub API.
2. Commits the configured `.GITCLAW/` folder.
3. Opens a pull request with a descriptive body and setup instructions.
4. Optionally creates the API key secret (if permissions allow).

The user is shown a link to the PR on GitHub.

### Step 5 — Dashboard

After installation, the dashboard provides ongoing management:

## Strengths

- **Richest user experience** — A full web application with visual configuration, management dashboard, analytics, and community features.
- **Centralized management** — Install, configure, update, and monitor gitclaw across all repositories from a single interface.
- **Analytics and insights** — Aggregate data across installations to show usage patterns, costs, and effectiveness.
- **Community features** — Agent personality gallery, showcase, and shared configurations create a community around gitclaw.
- **Bulk operations** — Install or update across many repos at once, ideal for organizations.
- **Professional presence** — A dedicated website establishes gitclaw as a serious tool with its own identity.
- **Documentation hub** — Centralized docs, tutorials, and guides in one place.

---

## Limitations

- **Hosting and maintenance** — Unlike the self-contained folder approach, a website requires ongoing hosting, maintenance, and monitoring. Even serverless platforms require attention.
- **External dependency** — Introduces a dependency on an external service. If the site goes down, management features are unavailable (though installed gitclaw instances continue to work independently).
- **OAuth token management** — Storing user OAuth tokens is a significant security responsibility. Tokens must be encrypted, rotated, and revocable.
- **Cost** — While serverless hosting is cheap, a full-featured website with a database, CDN, and custom domain has non-zero costs.
- **Development effort** — Building a full web application is significantly more work than the other delivery methods.
- **Privacy considerations** — Collecting analytics and storing installation data raises privacy questions that need clear policies.
- **Domain management** — A custom domain requires registration, DNS configuration, SSL certificates (usually automatic), and annual renewal.

---

## Security Considerations

- **OAuth token encryption** — All stored tokens must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Token scope minimization** — Request only the minimum OAuth scopes needed (repo contents, pull requests).
- **Session management** — Implement secure session handling with CSRF protection and session expiry.
- **Rate limiting** — Protect API endpoints from abuse with rate limiting.
- **Content Security Policy** — Implement strict CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Audit logging** — Log all installation and uninstallation actions for accountability.
- **Data retention** — Define clear policies for how long user data and analytics are retained.

---

## When to Use This Method

This method is ideal when:

- gitclaw has reached **significant adoption** and needs a professional management platform.
- You want to offer **analytics, insights, and community features** beyond basic installation.
- Your user base includes **organizations** that need centralized management across many repos.
- You want to build a **brand and community** around gitclaw.

---

## When to Consider Alternatives

Consider a different delivery method when:

- You are in the **early stages** and don't need a full web application (start with [GitHub Pages portal](./github-pages-self-service-portal.md)).
- Your users prefer **self-hosted, zero-dependency** approaches (use the [fork/import installer](./fork-import-installer.md)).
- You want to **minimize maintenance** overhead (consider [GitHub Marketplace Action](./github-marketplace-action.md) or [template repo](./github-template-repository.md)).

- [GitHub Application](./github-application.md) — Could be the backend powering the website's installation feature.
- [CLI Tool (npx / bunx)](./cli-tool.md) — The website could generate customized CLI commands.
