Drop a single `.GITCLAW` folder into any repo and you have a fully functional AI agent — no servers, no external services, no extra infrastructure.\n\n> **New here?** Check the [Quick Start](QUICKSTART.md) to get running in under 5 minutes.\n\nPowered by the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Every issue becomes a chat thread with an AI agent. Conversation history is committed to git, giving the agent long-term memory across sessions. It can search prior context, edit or summarize past conversations, and all changes are versioned.\n\nSince the agent can read and write files, you can build an evolving software project that updates itself as you open issues. Try asking it to set up a GitHub Pages site, then iterate on it issue by issue.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Single folder, any repo** — copy `.GITCLAW/` in and run the install script. Nothing to host or maintain.\n- **Zero infrastructure** — runs on GitHub Actions with your repo as the only backend.\n- **Persistent memory** — conversations are committed to git, so the agent remembers everything across sessions.\n- **Full auditability** — every interaction is versioned; review or roll back any change the agent made.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Create an issue** → the agent processes your request and replies as a comment.\n2. **Comment on the issue** → the agent resumes the same session with full prior context.\n3. **Everything is committed** → sessions and changes are pushed to the repo after every turn.\n\nThe agent reacts with 👀 while working and removes it when done.\n\n### Repo as storage\n\nAll state lives in the repo:\n\n```\n.GITCLAW/state/\n  issues/\n    1.json          # maps issue #1 -> its session file\n  sessions/\n    2026-02-04T..._abc123.jsonl    # full conversation for issue #1\n```\n\nSince sessions are in git, the agent can grep its own history and edit or summarize past conversations.\n\n## Setup — Add to Any Repo\n\ngitclaw lives entirely inside a `.GITCLAW` folder that you drop into your repository.\n\n1. **Copy the `.GITCLAW` folder** into your repo's root.\n2. **Run the install script** to set up workflows and templates:\n   ```bash\n   bun .GITCLAW/install/GITCLAW-INSTALLER.ts\n   ```\n3. **Install dependencies:**\n   ```bash\n   cd .GITCLAW && bun install\n   ```\n4. **Add your Anthropic API key** — go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and create a secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.\n5. **Commit and push** the changes.\n6. **Open an issue** — the agent starts automatically.\n\nThe install script copies the workflow and issue template into the right places. Agent identity/instructions can live entirely in `.GITCLAW/AGENTS.md` (repo-root `AGENTS.md` is optional for project-local overrides). Everything gitclaw needs to run lives inside `.GITCLAW/`.\n\n### What's inside `.GITCLAW/`\n\n```\n.GITCLAW/\n  install/\n    GITCLAW-INSTALLER.ts    # Setup script — installs workflows & templates\n    GITCLAW-WORKFLOW-AGENT.yml    # GitHub Actions workflow template\n    hatch.md              # Issue template for bootstrapping agent identity\n    GITCLAW-AGENTS.md       # Default agent identity file installed as AGENTS.md\n  lifecycle/\n    GITCLAW-AGENT.ts      # Core agent orchestrator\n    GITCLAW-INDICATOR.ts  # Adds 👀 reaction on issue activity\n    GITCLAW-ENABLED.ts    # Fail-closed guard — verifies opt-in sentinel exists\n  .pi/                    # Agent personality & skills config\n  AGENTS.md               # Agent identity file\n  install/package.json  # Dependencies\n  install/package-lock.json # NPM lockfile\n  bun.lock                # Bun lockfile\n```\n\n## Security\n\nThe workflow only responds to repository **owners, members, and collaborators**. Random users cannot trigger the agent on public repos.\n\nIf you plan to use gitclaw for anything private, **make the repo private**. Public repos mean your conversation history is visible to everyone, but get generous GitHub Actions usage.\n\n## Configuration\n\nEdit `.github/workflows/agent.yml` to customize:\n\n- **Model:** Add `--provider` and `--model` flags to the `pi` command.\n- **Tools:** Restrict with `--tools read,grep,find,ls` for read-only analysis.\n- **Thinking:** Add `--thinking high` for harder tasks.\n- **Trigger:** Adjust the `on:` block to filter by labels, assignees, etc.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nBuilt on top of [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) by [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/badlogic).\n\nThanks to [ymichael](https://github.com/ymichael) for nerdsniping me with the idea of an agent that runs in GitHub Actions.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771595858715}}

Here's how it could work with this repo:\n\nThe GitClaw agent you're running has all the ingredients to **generate and maintain a GitHub Pages website** for this repo. Here's the practical breakdown:\n\n### What's already in place\n- The agent can **read and write files** to the repo\n- All changes are **committed to git** automatically\n- The README even hints at this: *\"Try asking it to set up a GitHub Pages site, then iterate on it issue by issue.\"*\n\n### How to do it\n\n**1. Bootstrap the site** — Open an issue asking the agent to:\n   - Create a `docs/` folder (or use the repo root) with an `index.html`\n   - Generate a landing page from the existing README/docs content\n   - Add CSS styling, responsive layout, etc.\n\n**2. Enable GitHub Pages** — In repo Settings → Pages, point it to the `docs/` folder (or a `gh-pages` branch).\n\n**3. Iterate via issues** — Each new issue becomes an update request:\n   - *\"Add a features section with icons\"*\n   - *\"Update the site to reflect the new roadmap\"*\n   - *\"Add a dark mode toggle\"*\n   - *\"Regenerate the changelog section from recent commits\"*\n\n### What makes this especially viable here\n\n| Capability | Why it works |\n|---|---|\n| **File read/write** | Agent can generate HTML/CSS/JS and commit it |\n| **Persistent memory** | Agent remembers the site structure across sessions |\n| **Full repo access** | Agent can read README.md, docs/, etc. to keep the site in sync with source-of-truth content |\n| **Git history** | Every site change is versioned — easy to review or roll back |\n| **GitHub Actions trigger** | Site updates happen automatically when you comment on an issue |\n\n### Limitations to keep in mind\n- **No build tools at runtime** — the agent runs in a GitHub Actions environment with standard tools, so a static HTML site (or a simple SSG) works best. Complex frameworks with build steps are possible but add friction.\n- **No live preview** — you'd review changes after they're committed and deployed to Pages.\n- **Manual enabling** — GitHub Pages itself needs to be turned on once in repo settings.\n\n### Want me to do it now?\n\nI can scaffold a GitHub Pages site right now in this repo — generate an `index.html` with styling based on your existing README and docs content.

The standard approach for GitHub Pages is:\n\n### Use a `gh-pages` branch\n\nThis is the cleanest separation — your main branch stays untouched, and the website lives on an orphan branch:\n\n1. **Agent generates the site** and pushes to a `gh-pages` branch\n2. **GitHub Pages** serves from that branch\n3. **Main branch** has zero website files\n\n### How it works in practice\n\nThe agent (running in GitHub Actions) would:\n\n1.
