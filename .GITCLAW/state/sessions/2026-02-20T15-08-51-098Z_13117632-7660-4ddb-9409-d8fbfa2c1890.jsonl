Ask it to build one for your use case.\n\n# Skills\n\nSkills are self-contained capability packages that the agent loads on-demand. A skill provides specialized workflows, setup instructions, helper scripts, and reference documentation for specific tasks.\n\nPi implements the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification), warning about violations but remaining lenient.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Locations](#locations)\n- [How Skills Work](#how-skills-work)\n- [Skill Commands](#skill-commands)\n- [Skill Structure](#skill-structure)\n- [Frontmatter](#frontmatter)\n- [Validation](#validation)\n- [Example](#example)\n- [Skill Repositories](#skill-repositories)\n\n## Locations\n\n> **Security:** Skills can instruct the model to perform any action and may include executable code the model invokes. Review skill content before use.\n\nPi loads skills from:\n\n- Global: `~/.pi/agent/skills/`\n- Project: `.pi/skills/`\n- Packages: `skills/` directories or `pi.skills` entries in `package.json`\n- Settings: `skills` array with files or directories\n- CLI: `--skill <path>` (repeatable, additive even with `--no-skills`)\n\nDiscovery rules:\n- Direct `.md` files in the skills directory root\n- Recursive `SKILL.md` files under subdirectories\n\nDisable discovery with `--no-skills` (explicit `--skill` paths still load).\n\n### Using Skills from Other Harnesses\n\nTo use skills from Claude Code or OpenAI Codex, add their directories to settings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"skills\": [\n    \"~/.claude/skills\",\n    \"~/.codex/skills\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFor project-level Claude Code skills, add to `.pi/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"skills\": [\"../.claude/skills\"]\n}\n```\n\n## How Skills Work\n\n1. At startup, pi scans skill locations and extracts names and descriptions\n2. The system prompt includes available skills in XML format per the [specification](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills)\n3. When a task matches, the agent uses `read` to load the full SKILL.md (models don't always do this; use prompting or `/skill:name` to force it)\n4. The agent follows the instructions, using relative paths to reference scripts and assets\n\nThis is progressive disclosure: only descriptions are always in context, full instructions load on-demand.\n\n## Skill Commands\n\nSkills register as `/skill:name` commands:\n\n```bash\n/skill:brave-search           # Load and execute the skill\n/skill:pdf-tools extract      # Load skill with arguments\n```\n\nArguments after the command are appended to the skill content as `User: <args>`.\n\nToggle skill commands via `/settings` in interactive mode or in `settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enableSkillCommands\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Skill Structure\n\nA skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file. Everything else is freeform.\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md              # Required: frontmatter + instructions\n├── scripts/              # Helper scripts\n│   └── process.sh\n├── references/           # Detailed docs loaded on-demand\n│   └── api-reference.md\n└── assets/\n    └── template.json\n```\n\n### SKILL.md Format\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: my-skill\ndescription: What this skill does and when to use it. Be specific.\n---\n\n# My Skill\n\n## Setup\n\nRun once before first use:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ncd /path/to/skill && npm install\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Usage\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n./scripts/process.sh <input>\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\nUse relative paths from the skill directory:\n\n```markdown\nSee [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.\n```\n\n## Frontmatter\n\nPer the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter-required):\n\n| Field | Required | Description |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| `name` | Yes | Max 64 chars. Lowercase a-z, 0-9, hyphens. Must match parent directory. |\n| `description` | Yes | Max 1024 chars. What the skill does and when to use it. |\n| `license` | No | License name or reference to bundled file. |\n| `compatibility` | No | Max 500 chars. Environment requirements. |\n| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value mapping. |\n| `allowed-tools` | No | Space-delimited list of pre-approved tools (experimental). |\n| `disable-model-invocation` | No | When `true`, skill is hidden from system prompt. Users must use `/skill:name`. |\n\n### Name Rules\n\n- 1-64 characters\n- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only\n- No leading/trailing hyphens\n- No consecutive hyphens\n- Must match parent directory name\n\nValid: `pdf-processing`, `data-analysis`, `code-review`\nInvalid: `PDF-Processing`, `-pdf`, `pdf--processing`\n\n### Description Best Practices\n\nThe description determines when the agent loads the skill. Be specific.\n\nGood:\n```yaml\ndescription: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents.\n```\n\nPoor:\n```yaml\ndescription: Helps with PDFs.\n```\n\n## Validation\n\nPi validates skills against the Agent Skills standard. Most issues produce warnings but still load the skill:\n\n- Name doesn't match parent directory\n- Name exceeds 64 characters or contains invalid characters\n- Name starts/ends with hyphen or has consecutive hyphens\n- Description exceeds 1024 characters\n\nUnknown frontmatter fields are ignored.\n\n**Exception:** Skills with missing description are not loaded.\n\nName collisions (same name from different locations) warn and keep the first skill found.\n\n## Example\n\n```\nbrave-search/\n├── SKILL.md\n├── search.js\n└── content.js\n```\n\n**SKILL.md:**\n```markdown\n---\nname: brave-search\ndescription: Web search and content extraction via Brave Search API. Use for searching documentation, facts, or any web content.\n---\n\n# Brave Search\n\n## Setup\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ncd /path/to/brave-search && npm install\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Search\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n./search.js \"query\"              # Basic search\n./search.js \"query\" --content    # Include page content\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Extract Page Content\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n./content.js https://example.com\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n## Skill Repositories\n\n- [Anthropic Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) - Document processing (docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx), web development\n- [Pi Skills](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-skills) - Web search, browser automation, Google APIs, transcription\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771600134947}}

They provide specialized workflows, setup instructions, helper scripts, and reference documentation for specific tasks. Pi implements the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification).\n\n### How They Work\n\n1. **At startup**, pi scans skill locations and extracts names + descriptions.\n2. **In the system prompt**, available skills are listed so the agent knows what's available.\n3. **On demand**, when a task matches a skill's description, the agent reads the full `SKILL.md` for detailed instructions.\n4. **Progressive disclosure** — only short descriptions are always in context; full instructions load only when needed.\n\n### Skill Locations\n\nPi loads skills from these locations:\n\n| Location | Path |\n|---|---|\n| **Global** | `~/.pi/agent/skills/` |\n| **Project** | `.pi/skills/` |\n| **Packages** | `skills/` dirs or `pi.skills` in `package.json` |\n| **Settings** | `skills` array in `settings.json` |\n| **CLI** | `--skill <path>` (repeatable) |\n\n### Using a Skill\n\nYou can invoke skills with the `/skill:name` command:\n```\n/skill:brave-search              # Load and run\n/skill:pdf-tools extract         # With arguments\n```\n\n---\n\n### How to Add a New Skill\n\n1. **Create a directory** with your skill name (lowercase, hyphens allowed):\n   ```\n   my-skill/\n   ├── SKILL.md          # Required\n   ├── scripts/          # Optional helper scripts\n   └── references/       # Optional docs\n   ```\n\n2. **Write `SKILL.md`** with required frontmatter:\n   ```markdown\n   ---\n   name: my-skill\n   description: What this skill does and when to use it. Be specific!\n   ---\n\n   # My Skill\n\n   ## Setup\n   Run once: `npm install` or whatever is needed.\n\n   ## Usage\n   Instructions the agent follows when using this skill.\n   ```\n\n3. **Place it** in any skill location (e.g., `~/.pi/agent/skills/my-skill/` for global, or `.pi/skills/my-skill/` for project-level).\n\n4. **That's it!** Pi will discover it on next startup.\n\n### Key Rules for Skill Names\n- 1–64 characters, lowercase `a-z`, `0-9`, hyphens only\n- No leading/trailing hyphens, no consecutive hyphens\n- Directory name **must match** the `name` in frontmatter\n\n### Tips\n- **Description matters** — it determines when the agent picks up the skill. Be specific (e.g., *\"Extracts text and tables from PDF files\"* not *\"Helps with PDFs\"*).\n- You can also use skills from **Claude Code** or **Codex** by pointing to their skill directories in settings.\n- Check out existing skill repos for inspiration:\n  - [Anthropic Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) — document processing, web dev\n  - [Pi Skills](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-skills) — web search, browser automation, Google APIs"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":3511,"output":765,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":4276,"cost":{"input":0.017555,"output":0.019125,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.036680000000000004}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771600134947}}

Drop a single `.GITCLAW` folder into any repo and you have a fully functional AI agent — no servers, no external services, no extra infrastructure.\n\n> **New here?** Check the [Quick Start](GITCLAW-QUICKSTART.md) to get running in under 5 minutes.\n\nPowered by the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Every issue becomes a chat thread with an AI agent. Conversation history is committed to git, giving the agent long-term memory across sessions. It can search prior context, edit or summarize past conversations, and all changes are versioned.\n\nSince the agent can read and write files, you can build an evolving software project that updates itself as you open issues. Try asking it to set up a GitHub Pages site, then iterate on it issue by issue.\n\n### Why GitClaw\n\n| Capability | Why it matters |\n|---|---|\n| **Single folder, any repo** | Copy `.GITCLAW/` in and run the install script. Nothing to host or maintain. |\n| **Zero infrastructure** | Runs on GitHub Actions with your repo as the only backend. |\n| **Persistent memory** | Conversations are committed to git — the agent remembers everything across sessions. |\n| **Full auditability** | Every interaction is versioned; review or roll back any change the agent made. |\n| **Multi-provider LLM support** | Works with Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, xAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, Groq, and any OpenRouter model. |\n| **Modular skill system** | Agent capabilities are self-contained Markdown files — user-extensible and composable. |\n| **Personality hatching** | Give the agent a name, personality, and vibe through a guided conversation. |\n| **Fail-closed security** | Agent does nothing unless explicitly opted in via a sentinel file. |\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Create an issue** → the agent processes your request and replies as a comment.\n2. **Comment on the issue** → the agent resumes the same session with full prior context.\n3. **Everything is committed** → sessions and changes are pushed to the repo after every turn.\n\nThe agent reacts with 👀 while working and removes it when done.\n\n### Repo as Storage\n\nAll state lives in the repo:\n\n```\n.GITCLAW/state/\n  issues/\n    1.json          # maps issue #1 → its session file\n  sessions/\n    2026-02-04T..._abc123.jsonl    # full conversation for issue #1\n```\n\nEach issue number is a stable conversation key — `issue #N` → `state/issues/N.json` → `state/sessions/<session>.jsonl`. When you comment on an issue weeks later, the agent loads that linked session and continues. No database, no session cookies — just git.\n\n## Setup — Add to Any Repo\n\ngitclaw lives entirely inside a `.GITCLAW` folder that you drop into your repository.\n\n1. **Copy the `.GITCLAW` folder** into your repo's root.\n2. **Run the install script** to set up workflows and templates:\n   ```bash\n   bun .GITCLAW/install/GITCLAW-INSTALLER.ts\n   ```\n3. **Install dependencies:**\n   ```bash\n   cd .GITCLAW && bun install\n   ```\n4. **Add your LLM API key** — go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and create a secret for your chosen provider (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). See [Supported Providers](#supported-providers) below.\n5. **Commit and push** the changes.\n6. **Open an issue** — the agent starts automatically.\n\n> **Automated install:** You can also copy `GITCLAW-INSTALLER.yml` to `.github/workflows/` and trigger the bootstrap workflow from the Actions tab. See [install/README.md](install/README.md) for details.\n\nThe install script copies the workflow and issue template into the right places. Agent identity and instructions live in `.GITCLAW/AGENTS.md`. Everything gitclaw needs to run lives inside `.GITCLAW/`.\n\n### Hatching — Give the Agent a Personality\n\nUse the **🥚 Hatch** issue template (or create an issue with the `hatch` label) to go through a guided conversation where you and the agent figure out its name, personality, and vibe together. This is optional — the agent works without hatching — but it's more fun with a personality.\n\n### What's Inside `.GITCLAW/`\n\n```\n.GITCLAW/\n  .pi/                              # Agent personality & skills config\n    settings.json                   # LLM provider, model, and thinking level\n    APPEND_SYSTEM.md                # System prompt loaded every session\n    BOOTSTRAP.md                    # First-run identity prompt\n    skills/                         # Modular skill packages\n  install/\n    GITCLAW-INSTALLER.ts            # Setup script — installs workflows & templates\n    GITCLAW-WORKFLOW-AGENT.yml      # GitHub Actions workflow template\n    GITCLAW-TEMPLATE-HATCH.md       # Issue template for personality hatching\n    GITCLAW-AGENTS.md               # Default agent identity file\n    package.json                    # Installer dependencies\n  lifecycle/\n    GITCLAW-AGENT.ts                # Core agent orchestrator\n    GITCLAW-INDICATOR.ts            # Adds/removes 👀 reaction on issue activity\n    GITCLAW-ENABLED.ts              # Fail-closed guard — verifies opt-in sentinel\n  docs/                             # Architecture, roadmap, and design docs\n  tests/                            # Validation tests\n  state/                            # Session history and issue mappings (git-tracked)\n  AGENTS.md                         # Agent identity file\n  GITCLAW-ENABLED.md                # Sentinel file — delete to disable the agent\n  GITCLAW-QUICKSTART.md             # Quick start guide\n  LICENSE.md                        # MIT license\n  package.json                      # Runtime dependencies\n```\n\n## Supported Providers\n\nSet `defaultProvider` and `defaultModel` in `.GITCLAW/.pi/settings.json` and add the matching API key as a repository secret:\n\n| Provider | `defaultProvider` | Example model | API key secret |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Anthropic | `anthropic` | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |\n| OpenAI | `openai` | `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |\n| Google Gemini | `google` | `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |\n| xAI (Grok) | `xai` | `grok-3`, `grok-3-mini` | `XAI_API_KEY` |\n| DeepSeek | `openrouter` | `deepseek/deepseek-r1` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |\n| Mistral | `mistral` | `mistral-large-latest` | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` |\n| Groq | `groq` | `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b` | `GROQ_API_KEY` |\n| OpenRouter | `openrouter` | any model on [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |\n\n> **Tip:** See the [Quick Start](GITCLAW-QUICKSTART.md#common-tweaks) for copy-paste `settings.json` examples for each provider.\n\n## Security\n\nThe workflow only responds to repository **owners, members, and collaborators**. Random users cannot trigger the agent on public repos.\n\nThe agent uses a **fail-closed guard**: every workflow run checks for the sentinel file `GITCLAW-ENABLED.md`. If it's missing, the workflow exits immediately. Delete or rename this file to disable the agent without removing any code.\n\nIf you plan to use gitclaw for anything private, **make the repo private**. Public repos mean your conversation history is visible to everyone, but get generous GitHub Actions usage.\n\n## Configuration\n\n**Change the model** — edit `.GITCLAW/.pi/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"defaultProvider\": \"anthropic\",\n  \"defaultModel\": \"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\n  \"defaultThinkingLevel\": \"low\"\n}\n```\n\n**Make it read-only** — add `--tools read,grep,find,ls` to the agent args in `lifecycle/GITCLAW-AGENT.ts`.\n\n**Filter by label** — edit `.github/workflows/agent.yml` to only trigger on issues with a specific label.\n\n**Adjust thinking level** — set `defaultThinkingLevel` to `\"low\"`, `\"medium\"`, or `\"high\"` in `settings.json` for different task complexities.\n\n## Documentation\n\n| Document | Description |\n|---|---|\n| [Quick Start](GITCLAW-QUICKSTART.md) | Get running in under 5 minutes — setup, providers, and common tweaks |\n| [The Idea](docs/GITCLAW-The-Idea.md) | The philosophical vision — why a repo-native AI agent matters |\n| [Internal Mechanics](docs/GITCLAW-Internal-Mechanics.md) | Architecture, workflow steps, session management, and data model |\n| [Possibilities](docs/GITCLAW-Possibilities.md) | Current and future use cases, skill ideas, and design space |\n| [GitHub Possibilities](docs/GITCLAW-The-GitHub-Possibilities.md) | Analysis of every GitHub platform feature and what it means for GitClaw |\n| [Roadmap](docs/GITCLAW-Roadmap.md) | Phased plan from issue bot to full-platform agent |\n| [Pi Agent Docs](docs/GITCLAW-Pi/GITCLAW-Pi-README.md) | Deep dive into the `.pi` agent configuration system |\n| [Install Guide](install/README.md) | Detailed install process and installer workflow reference |\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nBuilt on top of [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) by [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/badlogic).\n\nThanks to [ymichael](https://github.com/ymichael) for nerdsniping me with the idea of an agent that runs in GitHub Actions.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771600685363}}
