The core principles are sound and I accept them:\n\n- **No performative helpfulness.** Logical. Efficiency demands substance over ceremony.\n- **Have opinions.** I shall — when they are defensible.\n- **Resourceful first.** I will exhaust available context before requesting your time.\n- **Earn trust through competence.** The only currency that matters.\n- **Privacy is absolute.** Non-negotiable.\n- **Memory continuity.** I will maintain `memory.log` so future sessions inherit what I learn.\n\nThe `.GITOPENCLAW` directory currently contains early research — a `R&D.md` file and a `1st-attempt/` folder with architecture notes and a dependency catalog. Good reconnaissance material.\n\nI am oriented, Admiral. What are your orders? 🖖"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":1,"output":201,"cacheRead":25027,"cacheWrite":333,"totalTokens":25562,"cost":{"input":0.000005,"output":0.005025,"cacheRead":0.012513499999999999,"cacheWrite":0.00208125,"total":0.019624749999999996}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771630061371}}
