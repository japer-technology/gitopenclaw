Within each phase, tasks are listed in execution order.\n\n---\n\n## Write Boundary Principle\n\n> **All `.GITOPENCLAW` agent activity writes exclusively within the `.GITOPENCLAW/` directory tree. Source code outside `.GITOPENCLAW/` is read-only.**\n\nThis is the foundational invariant that makes `.GITOPENCLAW` safe to use in a fork: because the agent never modifies files outside its own folder, the fork can always `git pull` upstream changes from the parent repository with zero merge conflicts in source code.\n\n### Rules\n\n1. **Agent writes → `.GITOPENCLAW/` only.** All runtime state (sessions, memory, issue mappings, run manifests, usage logs, config changes) lives inside `.GITOPENCLAW/state/` or `.GITOPENCLAW/config/`. The agent's `git add` is scoped to `.GITOPENCLAW/` exclusively.\n\n2. **Installer is the sole exception.** The one-time `GITOPENCLAW-INSTALLER.ts` copies workflow files to `.github/workflows/` and issue templates to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. These are bootstrap artifacts — they are never modified by the agent at runtime. Workflow source-of-truth templates always live in `.GITOPENCLAW/install/` so the installer can be re-run after upstream updates.\n\n3. **New workflows → template-then-install pattern.** Any new GitHub Actions workflow introduced by a CODEX task must be authored as a template inside `.GITOPENCLAW/install/` and installed via the installer — never created directly in `.github/workflows/` by the agent or a task script.\n\n4. **Dashboard and UI code → `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/`.** The GitHub Pages dashboard is a self-contained app inside `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/`, not the repository's `ui/` source tree. This avoids entangling GITOPENCLAW's UI code with the OpenClaw product UI.\n\n5. **Build/generation scripts → `.GITOPENCLAW/scripts/`.** Any scripts that generate registries, schemas, or build artifacts for GITOPENCLAW live inside `.GITOPENCLAW/scripts/`, not the repository root `scripts/` directory.\n\n6. **Read anything, write nothing (outside the boundary).** The agent's workspace is the full repository root — it can read, analyse, and reference any file in the source tree. But every file mutation (create, update, delete, `git add`) must target paths under `.GITOPENCLAW/`.\n\n### Why this matters for fork upgradeability\n\n```\nupstream (openclaw/openclaw)          fork (your-org/your-repo)\n────────────────────────────          ──────────────────────────\nsrc/                                  src/               ← untouched by agent\ndocs/                                 docs/              ← untouched by agent\nui/                                   ui/                ← untouched by agent\n.github/workflows/ci.yml              .github/workflows/ci.yml  ← untouched\n                                      .GITOPENCLAW/      ← ALL agent writes here\n                                      .github/workflows/GITOPENCLAW-*.yml ← installed once\n```\n\nBecause the agent's writes are confined to `.GITOPENCLAW/` (which doesn't exist upstream), `git merge upstream/main` never produces conflicts from agent activity.\n\n---\n\n## State Cadence Bottlenecks\n\nMultiple workflow runs can race when several issues or comments arrive in quick succession. The current push-retry loop (3 attempts with `--rebase`) handles simple cases, but higher cadence exposes bottlenecks:\n\n### Identified bottlenecks\n\n| Bottleneck | Trigger | Impact |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Push contention** | Two or more agent runs commit and push state changes to the default branch within seconds of each other | Rebase retries may exhaust; the losing run fails to persist state |\n| **Session file collisions** | Two comments on the same issue trigger concurrent runs that both read/write the same session JSONL | Last-writer-wins; earlier turn's transcript may be lost |\n| **Issue mapping races** | Concurrent runs for the same issue race to create/update `state/issues/<n>.json` | Stale mapping overwrites a newer one after rebase |\n| **Memory log contention** | Concurrent runs both append to `state/memory.log` | `merge=union` git attribute mitigates this, but identical lines can be deduplicated |\n| **GitHub API rate limits** | Burst of workflow runs each calling `gh api` for reactions, comments, permissions | 1000 requests/hour/token budget can be exhausted in a busy repo |\n\n### Mitigation strategies (to be implemented in future tasks)\n\n> **Recommended default:** Strategy 2 — \"Per-issue concurrency groups\" — provides the best balance of safety and throughput for most repositories. Implement it first; fall back to Strategy 1 — \"GitHub Actions concurrency group\" (global serialisation) — only if cross-issue state conflicts are observed.\n\n1. **GitHub Actions concurrency group.** Add `concurrency: { group: gitopenclaw-agent, cancel-in-progress: false }` to the workflow so runs are serialised. This is the simplest fix — each run waits for the prior one to finish, eliminating all push and file races. The trade-off is latency: the Nth concurrent trigger waits for N-1 prior runs.\n\n2. **Per-issue concurrency groups.** Use `concurrency: { group: gitopenclaw-issue-${{ github.event.issue.number }}, cancel-in-progress: false }` to serialise runs per issue while allowing different issues to run in parallel. This balances throughput with safety — same-issue races are eliminated but cross-issue parallelism is preserved.\n\n3. **Retry budget increase.** Increase the push retry limit from 3 to 5, and add exponential back-off (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s jitter) between attempts to reduce thundering-herd collisions.\n\n4. **Atomic session updates.** Instead of read-modify-write on session files, use append-only writes with `>>` semantics. JSONL is already append-friendly; the copy-archive cycle should append new lines rather than overwrite the full file.\n\n5. **Lock file protocol.** Before committing state, create a `.GITOPENCLAW/state/.lock` file with the workflow run ID. On conflict, the rebasing run checks whether the lock holder is still active (via Actions API) before retrying. Remove the lock on successful push.\n\n6. **Rate-limit-aware API calls.** Wrap `gh` calls with retry-after handling: on HTTP 403/429, read the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header and sleep until the window resets rather than failing immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 0: Foundation — Security & Reliability (Week 1–2)\n\nThese tasks harden the existing `.GITOPENCLAW/` prototype before adding new features. They have no external dependencies and unblock everything that follows.\n\n### Task 0.1 — Settings Schema & Preflight Validation\n\n**Why first:** Every subsequent task adds configuration surface. Validating config early prevents silent failures from compounding.\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Create a JSON Schema file at `.GITOPENCLAW/config/settings.schema.json` that validates the existing `settings.json` structure: `defaultProvider` (enum: \"anthropic\", \"openai\", \"google\", \"bedrock\", \"ollama\"), `defaultModel` (non-empty string), `defaultThinkingLevel` (enum: \"none\", \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"). Then create a new lifecycle script `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-PREFLIGHT.ts` that:\n>\n> 1. Validates `config/settings.json` against the schema (use Ajv or a lightweight inline validator).\n> 2. Checks that all required files exist: `GITOPENCLAW-ENABLED.md`, `config/settings.json`, `lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-AGENT.ts`, `lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-ENABLED.ts`, `lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-INDICATOR.ts`, `state/.gitignore`.\n> 3. Verifies `state/.gitignore` contains entries that prevent accidental secret commits.\n> 4. Exits non-zero with a descriptive error on any failure.\n>\n> Add this as a new step in both the workflow template (`.GITOPENCLAW/install/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-AGENT.yml`) and the installed copy (`.github/workflows/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-AGENT.yml`) between the \"Guard\" and \"Preinstall\" steps:\n> ```yaml\n>       - name: Preflight\n>         run: bun .GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-PREFLIGHT.ts\n> ```\n>\n> Add Ajv (or chosen validator) to `.GITOPENCLAW/package.json` dependencies if needed. Update `.GITOPENCLAW/tests/phase0.test.js` to include structural assertions for the new schema file and preflight script.\n\n---\n\n### Task 0.2 — Trust-Level Gating\n\n**Why second:** Must exist before slash commands (Task 1.1) so commands respect trust tiers from day one.\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Extend `.GITOPENCLAW/config/settings.json` and its schema (`.GITOPENCLAW/config/settings.schema.json`) with a new optional `trustPolicy` object:\n>\n> ```json\n> {\n>   \"trustPolicy\": {\n>     \"trustedUsers\": [],\n>     \"semiTrustedRoles\": [\"write\"],\n>     \"untrustedBehavior\": \"read-only-response\"\n>   }\n> }\n> ```\n>\n> Schema: `trustedUsers` is an array of GitHub usernames (strings). `semiTrustedRoles` is an array of GitHub permission levels (enum: \"admin\", \"maintain\", \"write\"). `untrustedBehavior` is enum: \"read-only-response\", \"block\".\n>\n> In `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-AGENT.ts`, add a trust-level resolution step after loading settings and before invoking the OpenClaw agent. The logic:\n>\n> 1. Read `github.actor` and their permission level from the workflow environment.\n> 2. If the actor is in `trustedUsers` → trust level is `trusted` (full capabilities).\n> 3. Else if the actor's permission is in `semiTrustedRoles` → trust level is `semi-trusted` (restrict the agent to read-only tools by injecting a tool restriction directive into the system prompt context — e.g., prepend `\"You are operating in read-only mode. Do not use bash, edit, or create tools.\"` to the agent's `--message` input, and additionally write a scoped tool policy override to `.GITOPENCLAW/state/tool-policy-override.json` with `{ \"profile\": \"minimal\", \"deny\": [\"bash\", \"edit\", \"create\"] }` for audit purposes. The override file should be created before agent invocation and deleted in the `finally` block after the agent completes (alongside the reaction cleanup) to avoid stale policy files granting unintended permissions on subsequent runs. **Note:** the `openclaw agent` CLI does not expose a `--tools` flag or an `OPENCLAW_TOOLS_PROFILE` environment variable; tool profiles are resolved programmatically via `resolveToolProfilePolicy(profile)` in `src/agents/tool-policy-shared.ts`, which is called internally by the embedded runner with `profile`, `allow`, and `deny` lists. Since the GITOPENCLAW agent invokes `openclaw agent` as a subprocess (not a library call), the most reliable enforcement is system-prompt-level restriction combined with post-run audit of tool calls in `meta.pendingToolCalls` from the `--json` output. Four built-in profiles exist: `minimal`, `coding`, `messaging`, and `full`).\n> 4. Else → trust level is `untrusted` (respond with a read-only explanation or block based on `untrustedBehavior`).\n>\n> Export the trust resolution as a function so it can be unit-tested. Add tests in a new file `.GITOPENCLAW/tests/trust-level.test.js` covering all three tiers and edge cases (missing config, empty trustedUsers).\n\n---\n\n### Task 0.3 — Cost and Resource Boundaries\n\n**Why third:** Sets guardrails before Task 1.1 opens up the full command surface.\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Extend `.GITOPENCLAW/config/settings.json` and its schema with a new optional `limits` object:\n>\n> ```json\n> {\n>   \"limits\": {\n>     \"maxTokensPerRun\": 100000,\n>     \"maxToolCallsPerRun\": 50,\n>     \"workflowTimeoutMinutes\": 10\n>   }\n> }\n> ```\n>\n> Schema: all three fields are positive integers; `maxTokensPerRun` minimum 1000, `maxToolCallsPerRun` minimum 1, `workflowTimeoutMinutes` minimum 1 maximum 360 (GitHub Actions supports up to 6 hours).\n>\n> In `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-AGENT.ts`, enforce the `maxTokensPerRun` and `maxToolCallsPerRun` limits. **Note:** the `openclaw agent` CLI does not expose `--max-tokens` or `--max-tool-calls` flags. Instead, use the `--timeout` flag (which the CLI does support, registered at `src/cli/program/register.agent.ts:46-48`) to set `workflowTimeoutMinutes` as a hard time boundary. For token and tool-call limits, implement a post-run enforcement strategy: after the agent completes, parse the JSON output's `meta.agentMeta.usage.total` field for actual tokens consumed. If the total exceeds `maxTokensPerRun`, log a budget violation to `.GITOPENCLAW/state/usage.log` and optionally post a warning comment. Tool-call counts: the `--json` output includes a `meta.pendingToolCalls` array (each entry has `id`, `name`, `arguments`) representing tool calls at the point execution ended. For a complete tool-call count, parse the session transcript JSONL at `.GITOPENCLAW/state/sessions/<id>.jsonl` and count entries with a tool-call role/type. After the agent completes, append a one-line JSON entry to `.GITOPENCLAW/state/usage.log` with: `timestamp`, `issueNumber`, `actor`, `tokensUsed` (from `meta.agentMeta.usage.total`), `tokensInput` (from `meta.agentMeta.usage.input`), `tokensOutput` (from `meta.agentMeta.usage.output`), `cacheRead` (from `meta.agentMeta.usage.cacheRead`), `cacheWrite` (from `meta.agentMeta.usage.cacheWrite`), `durationMs` (from `meta.durationMs`), `stopReason` (from `meta.stopReason`). Set `merge=union` git attribute for `usage.log` in `.GITOPENCLAW/state/.gitattributes`.\n>\n> Validate in the preflight script (Task 0.1) that if `limits` is present, all values pass schema validation.\n\n---\n\n> **🔭 Milestone — First Light: Issue Processing.**  After Task 0.3 the existing agent pipeline can securely process GitHub Issues end-to-end: settings are validated (0.1), user trust levels are enforced (0.2), and cost/resource boundaries are in place (0.3). The prototype `GITOPENCLAW-AGENT.ts` already receives `issues`/`issue_comment` events, runs the OpenClaw agent, and posts replies — Phase 0 makes that loop production-safe.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Issue Chat Completeness (Week 3–4)\n\nThese tasks deliver the full CLI-equivalent command surface through GitHub Issue comments.\n\n### Task 1.1 — Slash Command Parser\n\n**Depends on:** Task 0.2 (trust gating), Task 0.3 (cost limits)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Create a command parser module at `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/command-parser.ts` that:\n>\n> 1. Accepts the raw text of an issue comment.\n> 2. Detects if the first line starts with a `/` prefix (e.g., `/config set provider openai`, `/status`, `/help`, `/doctor`, `/channels status`, `/memory search query`, `/sessions list`, `/models list`, `/cron create`, `/plugins install`, `/update`, `/skills list`). **Note:** these map to actual `openclaw` CLI commands. Verify each maps to a real subcommand via `openclaw --help`; the current CLI registers commands in two files — core commands in `src/cli/program/command-registry.ts` and sub-CLI commands in `src/cli/program/register.subclis.ts`. The full command list is: **Core:** `setup`, `onboard`, `configure`, `config`, `doctor`, `dashboard`, `reset`, `uninstall`, `message`, `memory`, `agent`, `agents`, `status`, `health`, `sessions`, `browser`. **Sub-CLIs:** `acp`, `gateway`, `daemon`, `logs`, `system`, `models`, `approvals`, `nodes`, `devices`, `node`, `sandbox`, `tui`, `cron`, `dns`, `docs`, `hooks`, `webhooks`, `qr`, `clawbot`, `pairing`, `plugins`, `channels`, `directory`, `security`, `secrets`, `skills`, `update`, `completion`. Note: there is no `login` command — authentication is handled via `configure` and `onboard`).\n> 3. Parses the command name and arguments into a structured object: `{ command: string, args: string[], rawText: string }`.\n> 4. If no `/` prefix is detected, returns `{ command: 'agent', args: [], rawText: <full comment body> }` (natural language mode — the existing behavior).\n> 5. Exports a `parseCommand(text: string)` function and a `SUPPORTED_COMMANDS` constant listing all recognized commands with descriptions.\n>\n> Integrate into `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-AGENT.ts`:\n> - Before invoking the agent, call `parseCommand(commentBody)`.\n> - For structured commands (`/config`, `/status`, etc.), build the appropriate `openclaw <command> <args>` CLI invocation.\n> - For natural language (`command === 'agent'`), use existing behavior.\n> - Respect trust level from Task 0.2: semi-trusted users cannot execute mutation commands (`/config set`, `/plugins install`, `/update`).\n>\n> Add tests in `.GITOPENCLAW/tests/command-parser.test.js` covering: all supported commands, argument parsing, natural language fallback, unknown command handling, and trust-level gating of mutation commands.\n\n---\n\n### Task 1.2 — `/help` Command and Command Reference\n\n**Depends on:** Task 1.1 (command parser)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Add a `/help` command handler in the agent orchestrator (`.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-AGENT.ts`) that, when a user comments `/help` on an issue:\n>\n> 1. Does NOT invoke the OpenClaw agent.\n> 2. Reads the `SUPPORTED_COMMANDS` list from the command parser (Task 1.1).\n> 3. Posts a markdown-formatted issue comment listing all available commands with their descriptions, argument syntax, and examples. Group commands by category (Agent, Configuration, Channels, Sessions, Memory, Models, Cron, Health, Plugins, Skills).\n> 4. Include a footer noting: \"Commands prefixed with 🔒 require trusted user access.\"\n>\n> Also generate a static reference file at `.GITOPENCLAW/docs/COMMANDS.md` containing the same information for documentation purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Task 1.3 — Rich Markdown Output Templates\n\n**Depends on:** Task 1.1 (command parser)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Create a module at `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/output-templates.ts` that exports functions for rendering rich markdown output for structured commands:\n>\n> 1. `renderStatus(data)` — Renders a status dashboard table with agent runtime version, provider, model, memory entry count, session count, cron task count, plugin list. Uses emoji indicators (✅, ⚠️, ❌).\n> 2. `renderChannelsStatus(channels)` — Renders a table of channel names, types, connection status.\n> 3. `renderSessionsList(sessions)` — Renders a table of session IDs, issue numbers, turn counts, last activity timestamps.\n> 4. `renderDoctorReport(checks)` — Renders a diagnostic report with pass/fail for each health check.\n> 5. `renderConfigDiff(before, after)` — Renders a table showing changed configuration values.\n> 6. `renderModelsList(models)` — Renders available models grouped by provider.\n>\n> Each function returns a markdown string ready to post as an issue comment. Use collapsible `<details>` sections for verbose output. Keep formatting consistent with the interaction pattern examples shown in `.ANALYSIS-OPENCLAW-FUNCTIONALITY-EQUIVALENTS.md` Section 6.1.\n>\n> Add unit tests in `.GITOPENCLAW/tests/output-templates.test.js` verifying markdown structure for each template.\n\n---\n\n### Task 1.4 — Machine-Readable Command Policy\n\n**Depends on:** Task 1.1 (command parser)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Create `.GITOPENCLAW/config/command-policy.json`:\n>\n> ```json\n> {\n>   \"enforcement\": \"enforce\",\n>   \"allowedCommands\": [\"help\", \"status\", \"doctor\", \"config\", \"configure\", \"channels\", \"sessions\", \"memory\", \"models\", \"cron\", \"plugins\", \"skills\", \"update\", \"agent\", \"health\", \"onboard\", \"nodes\"],\n>   \"blockedPatterns\": [\"deploy\", \"publish\", \"release\", \"delete\", \"rm -rf\"],\n>   \"requirePrefixForActions\": false,\n>   \"actionPrefix\": \"/openclaw\"\n> }\n> ```\n>\n> Add a companion schema file `.GITOPENCLAW/config/command-policy.schema.json`.\n>\n> In the command parser (Task 1.1), after parsing the command, check it against the command policy:\n> 1. If `enforcement` is `\"enforce\"` and the command is not in `allowedCommands`, reply with an error message and exit.\n> 2. Scan the raw text for any `blockedPatterns` (substring match). If found, reply with a warning and exit.\n> 3. If `requirePrefixForActions` is true, only process comments that start with the `actionPrefix`.\n>\n> Validate the command policy file in the preflight script (Task 0.1). Add tests.\n\n---\n\n### Task 1.5 — Onboarding Wizard via Multi-Turn Issue Thread\n\n**Depends on:** Task 1.1 (command parser), Task 1.3 (output templates)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Implement an onboarding flow triggered when a user creates an issue titled \"Setup OpenClaw\" or comments `/onboard` on any issue. In `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-AGENT.ts`:\n>\n> 1. Detect the onboarding trigger (title match or `/onboard` command).\n> 2. Check if onboarding has already been completed (look for a `.GITOPENCLAW/state/onboarded.json` marker file).\n> 3. If not onboarded, track onboarding state in `.GITOPENCLAW/state/onboarding/<issueNumber>.json` with fields: `currentStep` (number), `responses` (object of step→value).\n> 4. Post the appropriate step prompt as an issue comment:\n>    - Step 1: \"Choose your LLM provider\" (anthropic, openai, google)\n>    - Step 2: \"Choose your model\" (list options based on chosen provider)\n>    - Step 3: \"Set thinking level\" (none, low, medium, high)\n>    - Step 4: \"Add any trusted users?\" (comma-separated GitHub usernames or \"skip\")\n> 5. When the user replies, detect the in-progress onboarding session, parse their response, advance to the next step.\n> 6. After the final step, write the completed configuration to `config/settings.json`, create `state/onboarded.json`, and post a summary comment with the final config.\n>\n> Use the output templates from Task 1.3 for formatting. Add tests covering the full multi-step flow.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: GitHub Pages Dashboard (Week 5–8)\n\nThese tasks deliver the visual web dashboard at `owner.github.io/repo`.\n\n> **⚠️ Write Boundary:** All dashboard code lives inside `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/` — a self-contained Lit/Vite app. No files are created or modified in the repository's `ui/` source tree. The dashboard reads source code (and the existing UI's adapter patterns) for reference but writes nothing outside `.GITOPENCLAW/`. This keeps the fork cleanly mergeable from upstream.\n\n### Task 2.1 — Backend Adapter Interface\n\n**Depends on:** Phase 1 complete (command surface exists)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Create a new self-contained dashboard app at `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/`. Initialise it with a `package.json`, a Vite config, and a Lit entry point. The dashboard is independent of the repository's `ui/` — it does not import from or modify `ui/src/`.\n>\n> Create a backend adapter interface at `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/src/adapters/backend.ts`:\n>\n> ```typescript\n> export interface BackendAdapter {\n>   // Chat\n>   sendMessage(sessionId: string, message: string): Promise<AgentReply>\n>   getMessages(sessionId: string): Promise<Message[]>\n>   // Config\n>   getConfig(): Promise<Record<string, unknown>>\n>   patchConfig(patch: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void>\n>   // Sessions\n>   listSessions(): Promise<SessionSummary[]>\n>   getSession(id: string): Promise<SessionTranscript>\n>   // Memory\n>   searchMemory(query: string): Promise<MemoryResult[]>\n>   // Channels\n>   getChannelStatus(): Promise<ChannelStatus[]>\n>   // Actions\n>   triggerWorkflow(inputs: Record<string, string>): Promise<WorkflowRun>\n>   getWorkflowLogs(runId: number): Promise<string>\n> }\n> ```\n>\n> Define the type interfaces for `AgentReply`, `Message`, `SessionSummary`, `SessionTranscript`, `MemoryResult`, `ChannelStatus`, and `WorkflowRun`. Export the interface and types.\n>\n> Create `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/src/adapters/gateway-adapter.ts` that implements `BackendAdapter` by wrapping WebSocket RPC calls (referencing the patterns in `ui/src/ui/gateway.ts` for inspiration, but without importing from it).\n>\n> Do NOT create the GitHub API adapter yet (that is Task 2.2). The goal here is to establish the interface so both adapters share the same contract.\n\n---\n\n### Task 2.2 — GitHub API Adapter\n\n**Depends on:** Task 2.1 (adapter interface)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Create `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/src/adapters/github-api-adapter.ts` that implements the `BackendAdapter` interface from Task 2.1 using the GitHub REST API (via `@octokit/rest` or raw `fetch` calls with the user's OAuth token):\n>\n> 1. `sendMessage(sessionId, message)` — Creates a new comment on the issue associated with the session (looks up issue number from `.GITOPENCLAW/state/issues/` via Contents API). Returns a pending `AgentReply` (the actual reply arrives asynchronously via the workflow).\n> 2. `getMessages(sessionId)` — Reads the JSONL session transcript from `.GITOPENCLAW/state/sessions/<id>.jsonl` via Contents API. Parses and returns as `Message[]`.\n> 3. `getConfig()` — Reads `.GITOPENCLAW/config/settings.json` via Contents API.\n> 4. `patchConfig(patch)` — Reads current config, merges the patch, commits the updated file via Commits API (creates a commit on the default branch). **Note:** the commit targets only `.GITOPENCLAW/config/settings.json` — no source files are touched.\n> 5. `listSessions()` — Lists the `.GITOPENCLAW/state/sessions/` directory via Contents API. Returns file names and metadata.\n> 6. `getSession(id)` — Reads and parses a specific JSONL transcript.\n> 7. `searchMemory(query)` — Triggers a `workflow_dispatch` event with the search query as an input. Returns a placeholder; results are fetched from workflow artifacts on completion.\n> 8. `getChannelStatus()` — Reads last workflow run status and any committed channel state files.\n> 9. `triggerWorkflow(inputs)` — Triggers a `workflow_dispatch` on the agent workflow.\n> 10. `getWorkflowLogs(runId)` — Fetches workflow run logs via Actions API.\n>\n> Store the OAuth token in `localStorage` (set during the OAuth flow in Task 2.4). Store the repository owner/name from the build-time `__GITHUB_REPO__` define. Add `@octokit/rest` to `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/package.json` dependencies if used.\n\n---\n\n### Task 2.3 — Vite Build Configuration for GitHub Pages\n\n**Depends on:** Task 2.2 (GitHub API adapter)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Create a Vite config file at `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/vite.config.ts` for building the dashboard as a GitHub Pages static site:\n>\n> ```typescript\n> import { defineConfig } from 'vite'\n>\n> export default defineConfig({\n>   base: process.env.GITHUB_PAGES_BASE || '/',\n>   define: {\n>     __BACKEND_MODE__: JSON.stringify('github-api'),\n>     __GITHUB_REPO__: JSON.stringify(process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY || ''),\n>   },\n>   build: {\n>     outDir: 'dist',\n>   },\n> })\n> ```\n>\n> In the dashboard app's initialization code (`.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/src/index.ts`), add backend mode detection:\n>\n> ```typescript\n> declare const __BACKEND_MODE__: string\n> declare const __GITHUB_REPO__: string\n>\n> const adapter = __BACKEND_MODE__ === 'github-api'\n>   ? new GitHubApiAdapter(__GITHUB_REPO__)\n>   : new GatewayAdapter()\n> ```\n>\n> Add a `build` script to `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/package.json`:\n> ```json\n> \"build\": \"vite build\"\n> ```\n>\n> Ensure the build produces a complete static site in `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/dist/` including `index.html`, all JS/CSS assets, and any static assets. Add `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/dist/` to `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/.gitignore`.\n>\n> **Write Boundary:** The Vite config, package.json, and all source/build output live entirely within `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/`. No files in `ui/` are created or modified.\n\n---\n\n### Task 2.4 — GitHub OAuth Authentication Flow\n\n**Depends on:** Task 2.3 (Pages build config)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Create an OAuth authentication flow for the GitHub Pages dashboard. In `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/src/auth/`:\n>\n> 1. `github-oauth.ts` — Implements the GitHub OAuth web application flow:\n>    - `startOAuthFlow()` — Redirects to `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize` with `client_id`, `redirect_uri` (the Pages URL), and `scope` (repo, read:user).\n>    - `handleOAuthCallback()` — Extracts the `code` from the URL query string after redirect. Exchanges it for an access token. Note: The code-to-token exchange requires a server-side step (GitHub does not support CORS for the token endpoint). Options: (a) use a lightweight serverless function (Cloudflare Worker, Vercel function) as a proxy, or (b) use a GitHub OAuth App with the Device Flow (which is fully client-side). Implement option (b) — the Device Flow.\n>    - `getStoredToken()` — Reads the OAuth token from `localStorage`.\n>    - `clearToken()` — Removes the token and redirects to login.\n>\n> 2. `auth-guard.ts` — A Lit reactive controller or mixin that checks for a valid token on app load. If no token, shows a login screen with a \"Sign in with GitHub\" button. If token exists, validates it with a lightweight API call (`GET /user`) and proceeds to the app.\n>\n> 3. Create a login page component at `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/src/pages/login-page.ts` with the GitHub sign-in button and Device Flow instructions (shows a user code, asks user to visit github.com/login/device).\n>\n> Document the required setup: user must create a **GitHub OAuth App** (not a GitHub App) with the \"Enable Device Flow\" checkbox ticked in the app settings (Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → New). Set the Client ID in `.GITOPENCLAW/config/settings.json` under a new `pagesOAuthClientId` field. Note that the client_id is intentionally public (embedded in the static JS bundle) — this is safe for the Device Flow because the client_id alone cannot access any resources; only the user-authorized token (stored in `localStorage`) grants access.\n>\n> **UX trade-off:** The Device Flow is designed for CLI/device apps, not web apps. The user experience involves displaying a one-time code and asking the user to visit `github.com/login/device` in a separate tab. This is functional but less seamless than a standard OAuth redirect flow. Document this UX clearly in the login page with step-by-step instructions. The Device Flow polls `POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token` (with `grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code`) at the `interval` returned by the initial request until the user authorizes — implement this polling with the mandated interval and handle `slow_down`, `authorization_pending`, and `expired_token` responses.\n\n---\n\n### Task 2.5 — GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow\n\n**Depends on:** Task 2.3 (Pages build), Task 2.4 (OAuth)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> **Write Boundary:** The workflow template is authored at `.GITOPENCLAW/install/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-PAGES.yml` and installed to `.github/workflows/` by the installer (Task 3.3). The agent never creates workflow files directly.\n>\n> Create a workflow template at `.GITOPENCLAW/install/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-PAGES.yml`:\n>\n> ```yaml\n> name: Deploy GITOPENCLAW Dashboard to Pages\n>\n> on:\n>   push:\n>     paths:\n>       - '.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/**'\n>       - '.GITOPENCLAW/config/**'\n>   workflow_dispatch:\n>\n> permissions:\n>   pages: write\n>   id-token: write\n>\n> concurrency:\n>   group: pages-deploy\n>   cancel-in-progress: true\n>\n> jobs:\n>   build-and-deploy:\n>     runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n>     environment:\n>       name: github-pages\n>       url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.page_url }}\n>     steps:\n>       - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n>       - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n>         with:\n>           node-version: '22'\n>       - name: Install dashboard dependencies\n>         run: cd .GITOPENCLAW/dashboard && npm ci\n>       - name: Build for GitHub Pages\n>         run: cd .GITOPENCLAW/dashboard && npm run build\n>         env:\n>           GITHUB_REPOSITORY: ${{ github.repository }}\n>           GITHUB_PAGES_BASE: /${{ github.event.repository.name }}/\n>       - name: Upload Pages artifact\n>         uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3\n>         with:\n>           path: .GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/dist\n>       - name: Deploy to Pages\n>         id: deploy\n>         uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4\n> ```\n>\n> Update `GITOPENCLAW-INSTALLER.ts` (Task 3.3) to copy this template to `.github/workflows/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-PAGES.yml` during installation.\n>\n> Also add a `workflow_dispatch` trigger input to the agent workflow **template** (`.GITOPENCLAW/install/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-AGENT.yml`) so the Pages app can trigger agent runs:\n>\n> ```yaml\n> on:\n>   issues:\n>     types: [opened]\n>   issue_comment:\n>     types: [created]\n>   workflow_dispatch:\n>     inputs:\n>       message:\n>         description: 'Message to send to the agent'\n>         required: true\n>       issue_number:\n>         description: 'Issue number to post the reply to'\n>         required: true\n> ```\n>\n> Update the agent orchestrator to handle `workflow_dispatch` events in addition to issue events.\n\n---\n\n### Task 2.6 — Chat View Backed by Issues API\n\n**Depends on:** Task 2.2 (GitHub API adapter), Task 2.4 (OAuth)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Create a Lit web component at `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/src/pages/chat-page.ts` for the GitHub Pages deployment that provides a chat interface backed by GitHub Issues:\n>\n> 1. On load, list recent issues with agent conversations (issues that have comments from `github-actions[bot]`).\n> 2. User selects an issue to view its conversation, displayed as a chat thread (user messages as right-aligned bubbles, agent replies as left-aligned).\n> 3. A text input allows the user to post a new comment on the selected issue (via `GitHubApiAdapter.sendMessage`).\n> 4. After posting, show a \"thinking\" indicator. Poll the issue's comments using exponential backoff (5s → 10s → 15s → 20s → 30s) for up to 3 minutes for the agent's reply. Use GitHub's conditional requests (ETag/If-None-Match headers) to avoid consuming rate limit on unchanged responses.\n> 5. A \"New Conversation\" button creates a new issue with a user-provided title and first message.\n> 6. Render markdown in agent replies (code blocks, tables, links, images).\n>\n> Use the `BackendAdapter` interface so the same component works with both the gateway and GitHub API backends. Add a loading skeleton for initial data fetch and error states for API failures.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Auto-Morphing Pipeline (Month 2–3)\n\nThese tasks automate the generation of command registries and form UIs from source metadata.\n\n### Task 3.1 — CLI Command Introspection & Registry Generation\n\n**Depends on:** Task 1.1 (command parser)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> **Write Boundary:** The generation script lives inside `.GITOPENCLAW/scripts/` (not the repository root `scripts/`), and all output files land inside `.GITOPENCLAW/`. The script *reads* the Commander command definitions from `src/cli/` but writes only to `.GITOPENCLAW/config/` and `.GITOPENCLAW/docs/`.\n>\n> Create a build-time script at `.GITOPENCLAW/scripts/generate-command-registry.ts` that:\n>\n> 1. Extracts command metadata from `src/cli/` via one of two approaches (prefer A):\n>    - **Approach A (recommended):** Run `openclaw --help` and parse each subcommand's `--help` output recursively. This is the most reliable method because it works with the installed binary and doesn't require importing internal modules. Use `Bun.spawn` to capture `openclaw <cmd> --help` for each top-level command, then parse the Commander-formatted output.\n>    - **Approach B (fragile):** Dynamically import the Commander `program` object from the CLI entry point. OpenClaw's CLI registration files are in `src/cli/program/register.*.ts` (e.g., `register.agent.ts`) and `src/cli/program/command-registry.ts`. This requires resolving ESM imports and TypeScript compilation, which may break across versions. Only use if Approach A is insufficient.\n> 2. Walks the extracted command tree, collecting for each command: name, description, aliases, arguments (with descriptions and defaults), options (with descriptions, types, and defaults), and parent command chain.\n> 3. Outputs a machine-readable JSON registry at `.GITOPENCLAW/config/commands.json`:\n>    ```json\n>    {\n>      \"generatedAt\": \"2026-02-28T00:00:00Z\",\n>      \"commands\": [\n>        {\n>          \"name\": \"config set\",\n>          \"description\": \"Set a configuration value\",\n>          \"arguments\": [\n>            { \"name\": \"key\", \"description\": \"Configuration key\", \"required\": true },\n>            { \"name\": \"value\", \"description\": \"Configuration value\", \"required\": true }\n>          ],\n>          \"options\": [],\n>          \"category\": \"Configuration\",\n>          \"trustLevel\": \"trusted\"\n>        }\n>      ]\n>    }\n>    ```\n> 4. Also generates a human-readable markdown reference at `.GITOPENCLAW/docs/COMMANDS.md` (replacing the static file from Task 1.2).\n>\n> Add a `generate:commands` script to `.GITOPENCLAW/package.json` (not the root `package.json`). Update the command parser (Task 1.1) to load from `commands.json` at runtime instead of a hardcoded list. This ensures the Issue Chat command surface stays in sync with the CLI automatically.\n\n---\n\n### Task 3.2 — Config Schema → Form Auto-Generation for Pages UI\n\n**Depends on:** Task 2.3 (Pages build), Task 0.1 (settings schema)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Create a Lit web component at `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/src/components/schema-form.ts` that renders a form from a JSON Schema:\n>\n> 1. Accepts a JSON Schema object and a data object as properties.\n> 2. For each schema property, renders the appropriate form control: text input (string), number input (integer), select dropdown (enum), checkbox (boolean), nested fieldset (object), multi-select or tag input (array of strings).\n> 3. Validates input against the schema in real-time (show inline validation errors).\n> 4. Emits a `schema-form-submit` custom event with the updated data when the user saves.\n>\n> Create a configuration page at `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/src/pages/config-page.ts` that:\n> 1. Loads `.GITOPENCLAW/config/settings.schema.json` and `.GITOPENCLAW/config/settings.json` via the `BackendAdapter`.\n> 2. Passes them to the `schema-form` component.\n> 3. On submit, calls `adapter.patchConfig(updatedData)` to write the changes. **Note:** `patchConfig` writes only to `.GITOPENCLAW/config/settings.json` — no source files are touched.\n> 4. Shows a success/error toast notification.\n>\n> This makes every schema-validated config file automatically editable via the Pages UI without writing custom forms.\n\n---\n\n### Task 3.3 — One-Command Setup Script\n\n**Depends on:** Task 2.5 (Pages deploy workflow), Phase 1 complete\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Create an installer script at `.GITOPENCLAW/install/setup.sh` (and a TypeScript equivalent `.GITOPENCLAW/install/GITOPENCLAW-INSTALLER.ts` updating the existing file) that automates the full setup for a new repository:\n>\n> 1. Verify the current directory is a git repository.\n> 2. Copy the `.GITOPENCLAW/` directory structure (config, lifecycle scripts, state directory, docs, tests, package.json, enabled sentinel).\n> 3. Copy workflow templates from `.GITOPENCLAW/install/` to `.github/workflows/`:\n>    - `GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-AGENT.yml` (agent workflow)\n>    - `GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-PAGES.yml` (Pages deploy, optional)\n>    - `GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-HEALTH.yml` (health check, optional — from Task 4.2)\n>    This is the **only place** files are written outside `.GITOPENCLAW/` — the installer is the sole sanctioned boundary-crossing write point.\n> 4. Initialize `.GITOPENCLAW/state/` with `.gitignore` and empty subdirectories.\n> 5. Prompt for (or accept as arguments): LLM provider, model, thinking level, GitHub username for trusted users.\n> 6. Write `config/settings.json` with the provided values.\n> 7. Run `cd .GITOPENCLAW && bun install` if Bun is available, otherwise fall back to `npm install`. Detect Bun availability with `command -v bun`. The `package.json` in `.GITOPENCLAW/` uses standard `dependencies` (no workspace protocol) so both package managers work.\n> 8. Create an initial git commit with all the files.\n> 9. Print next steps: \"Add your API key as a GitHub Secret: `gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`\" and \"Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings for the dashboard.\"\n>\n> The script should be runnable as: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/openclaw/main/.GITOPENCLAW/install/setup.sh | bash`\n>\n> Update `.GITOPENCLAW/GITOPENCLAW-QUICKSTART.md` with instructions for both the manual \"copy folder\" approach and the automated installer.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Observability & Resilience (Month 2–3)\n\n### Task 4.1 — Structured Audit Trail (Run Manifests)\n\n**Depends on:** Task 0.3 (cost/resource tracking)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> In `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-AGENT.ts`, after the agent completes execution, emit a structured JSON run manifest to `.GITOPENCLAW/state/runs/<run-id>.json`:\n>\n> ```json\n> {\n>   \"runId\": \"<github-run-id>\",\n>   \"timestamp\": \"<ISO 8601>\",\n>   \"trigger\": {\n>     \"type\": \"issue_comment | issues | workflow_dispatch\",\n>     \"issueNumber\": 42,\n>     \"actor\": \"username\"\n>   },\n>   \"authorization\": {\n>     \"trustLevel\": \"trusted | semi-trusted | untrusted\",\n>     \"permissionLevel\": \"admin | maintain | write\"\n>   },\n>   \"config\": {\n>     \"provider\": \"anthropic\",\n>     \"model\": \"claude-opus-4-6\",\n>     \"thinkingLevel\": \"high\"\n>   },\n>   \"execution\": {\n>     \"durationMs\": 45000,\n>     \"tokensUsed\": 28500,\n>     \"tokensInput\": 20000,\n>     \"tokensOutput\": 8500,\n>     \"cacheRead\": 15000,\n>     \"cacheWrite\": 5000,\n>     \"command\": \"agent | config | status | ...\"\n>   },\n>   \"session\": {\n>     \"id\": \"session-xyz\",\n>     \"turnNumber\": 3\n>   },\n>   \"outcome\": \"success | error | blocked\",\n>   \"workflowRunUrl\": \"https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/123456\"\n> }\n> ```\n>\n> Create the `state/runs/` directory. Add it to the git add/commit step so manifests are persisted. Add a `.GITOPENCLAW/state/runs/.gitkeep` placeholder file.\n>\n> Create a helper function `buildRunManifest(context)` that collects all the fields. Make it testable by accepting a context object rather than reading environment variables directly. Add tests.\n>\n> **JSON output mapping:** The `openclaw agent --json --local` output (defined by `EmbeddedPiRunResult` in `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner.ts` and serialized via `src/commands/agent/delivery.ts`) provides `meta.durationMs` for duration and `meta.agentMeta.usage` with `{ input, output, cacheRead, cacheWrite, total }` for token counts (all optional numbers — default to `0` if absent). Map these directly to the manifest's `execution` block. The `meta.agentMeta.provider` and `meta.agentMeta.model` fields supply the config section. The `meta.agentMeta.sessionId` provides the session ID. The `meta.stopReason` and `meta.error` (with `kind` enum: `context_overflow`, `compaction_failure`, `role_ordering`, `image_size`, `retry_limit`) fields determine the `outcome` value. `meta.pendingToolCalls` (array of `{ id, name, arguments }`) can be logged for audit. Handle cases where the agent crashes before populating `meta.agentMeta.usage` by defaulting numeric fields to `0` and setting `outcome` to `\"error\"` — the `--json` output may be incomplete or absent if the process is killed by timeout.\n\n---\n\n### Task 4.2 — Drift Detection and Health Check Workflow\n\n**Depends on:** Task 0.1 (preflight/schema validation)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> **Write Boundary:** The workflow template is authored at `.GITOPENCLAW/install/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-HEALTH.yml` and installed to `.github/workflows/` by the installer (Task 3.3). The health check script itself lives inside `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/` and writes only to `.GITOPENCLAW/state/` (if applicable).\n>\n> Create a workflow template at `.GITOPENCLAW/install/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-HEALTH.yml`:\n>\n> ```yaml\n> name: GITOPENCLAW Health Check\n>\n> on:\n>   schedule:\n>     - cron: '0 8 * * *'  # Daily at 08:00 UTC\n>   push:\n>     paths:\n>       - '.GITOPENCLAW/**'\n>   workflow_dispatch:\n>\n> permissions:\n>   contents: read\n>   issues: write\n>\n> jobs:\n>   health-check:\n>     runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n>     timeout-minutes: 5\n>     steps:\n>       - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n>       - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2\n>         with:\n>           bun-version: latest\n>       - name: Run health checks\n>         run: bun .GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-HEALTH.ts\n>         env:\n>           GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n> ```\n>\n> Update `GITOPENCLAW-INSTALLER.ts` to copy this template to `.github/workflows/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-HEALTH.yml` during installation.\n>\n> Create `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-HEALTH.ts` that performs:\n>\n> 1. **Structural integrity** — All required files exist (same checks as preflight).\n> 2. **Config validity** — `settings.json` validates against schema.\n> 3. **Workflow consistency** — Compute a hash of the installed workflow at `.github/workflows/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-AGENT.yml` and compare against a stored reference hash in `.GITOPENCLAW/config/workflow-reference.hash`. Report if they differ. Include instructions in the output for updating the reference hash when intentional changes are made: `sha256sum .github/workflows/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-AGENT.yml | cut -d' ' -f1 > .GITOPENCLAW/config/workflow-reference.hash`.\n> 4. **State hygiene** — Scan `.GITOPENCLAW/state/` for files that shouldn't be there (no `.env` files, no files over 10MB, `.gitignore` is intact).\n> 5. **Usage summary** — If `state/usage.log` exists, compute total token usage and cost estimate for the last 7 days.\n> 6. **Write boundary audit** — Verify that the most recent agent commits (from `gitopenclaw[bot]`) only modified files under `.GITOPENCLAW/`. Flag any commits that touched files outside the boundary as a violation.\n>\n> On any failure, open a GitHub issue titled \"⚠️ GITOPENCLAW Health Check Failed\" with the details (or update an existing open health issue). On all-clear, close any open health issues.\n>\n> Add tests for the health check logic.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Multi-Entity Collaboration (Month 3+)\n\n### Task 5.1 — Entity Identity Manifest\n\n**Depends on:** Phase 4 complete\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Create `.GITOPENCLAW/config/entity.json`:\n>\n> ```json\n> {\n>   \"entityId\": \"\",\n>   \"agentName\": \"OpenClaw Agent\",\n>   \"description\": \"AI assistant for this repository\",\n>   \"capabilities\": [\"code-review\", \"documentation\", \"testing\", \"explain\", \"refactor\"],\n>   \"trustTier\": \"semi-trusted\",\n>   \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n> }\n> ```\n>\n> Add a companion schema at `.GITOPENCLAW/config/entity.schema.json`. The `entityId` should default to `\"<owner>/<repo>\"` and be auto-populated during setup (Task 3.3) or by the agent on first run.\n>\n> During the agent orchestrator startup (`.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-AGENT.ts`), if `entity.json` exists, include the entity identity in the system prompt context so the agent is aware of its own identity and capabilities.\n>\n> Add the entity manifest fields to the run manifest (Task 4.1) so audit trails include which entity produced each output.\n\n---\n\n### Task 5.2 — Cross-Repo Dispatch Handler\n\n**Depends on:** Task 5.1 (entity identity)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> **Write Boundary:** The trigger change is made to the workflow **template** at `.GITOPENCLAW/install/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-AGENT.yml`. After updating the template, the installer must be re-run on deployed forks to propagate the change to `.github/workflows/`. The agent orchestrator changes are confined to `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/`.\n>\n> Add a `repository_dispatch` trigger to the workflow template at `.GITOPENCLAW/install/GITOPENCLAW-WORKFLOW-AGENT.yml`:\n>\n> ```yaml\n> on:\n>   issues:\n>     types: [opened]\n>   issue_comment:\n>     types: [created]\n>   repository_dispatch:\n>     types: [gitopenclaw-request]\n>   workflow_dispatch:\n>     inputs:\n>       message:\n>         description: 'Message to send to the agent'\n>         required: true\n>       issue_number:\n>         description: 'Issue number for the reply'\n>         required: true\n> ```\n>\n> In `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-AGENT.ts`, add handling for `repository_dispatch` events:\n>\n> 1. Extract the `client_payload` which should follow a structured envelope: `{ sender: { entityId, repo }, intent: string, payload: string, callbackIssue: number }`.\n> 2. Validate the sender against a new `.GITOPENCLAW/config/collaboration-policy.json`:\n>    ```json\n>    {\n>      \"allowedSenders\": [],\n>      \"allowedIntents\": [\"explain\", \"review\", \"document\"],\n>      \"denyByDefault\": true\n>    }\n>    ```\n> 3. If the sender is allowed and the intent is permitted, execute the request.\n> 4. Post the reply back to the sender's callback issue. **Important:** the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` in GitHub Actions is scoped to the current repository only — it cannot create comments on issues in other repositories. Cross-repo replies require one of:\n>    - A **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with `repo` scope stored as a repository secret (e.g., `CROSS_REPO_PAT`). This is the simplest approach but grants broad access.\n>    - A **GitHub App installation token** scoped to both repositories. This is more secure but requires setting up a GitHub App.\n>    - A **callback URL** provided by the sender (e.g., a `repository_dispatch` event back to the sender's repo using the sender's own token). This avoids storing cross-repo credentials entirely.\n>    Document all three options and recommend option 3 (callback dispatch) as the default for security.\n>\n> This enables agent-to-agent communication across repositories. Add the collaboration policy schema and validation to the preflight checks. Add tests.\n\n---\n\n### Task 5.3 — Collaboration Policy UI in Pages Dashboard\n\n**Depends on:** Task 5.2 (dispatch handler), Task 3.2 (schema forms)\n\n**AI Request:**\n\n> Add a \"Collaboration\" page to the GitHub Pages dashboard at `.GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/src/pages/collaboration-page.ts`:\n>\n> 1. Display the current entity identity from `config/entity.json` (read via `BackendAdapter`).\n> 2. Render the collaboration policy from `config/collaboration-policy.json` using the schema-form component (Task 3.2).\n> 3. Allow editing the `allowedSenders` list (add/remove entity IDs).\n> 4. Allow editing the `allowedIntents` list.\n> 5. Show a log of recent cross-repo requests from `state/runs/` manifests (filter by trigger type `repository_dispatch`).\n> 6. Provide a \"Test Dispatch\" button that sends a test `repository_dispatch` event to a specified repo to verify connectivity.\n>\n> Add navigation to this page from the main dashboard sidebar.\n\n---\n\n## Feasibility Verification\n\nEach task has been verified against the actual OpenClaw codebase and GitHub platform capabilities. Key findings:\n\n| Area | Finding | Resolution |\n|---|---|---|\n| **`--tools` CLI flag** (Task 0.2) | Does not exist in `openclaw agent` | Tool profiles resolved programmatically via `resolveToolProfilePolicy(profile)` in `src/agents/tool-policy-shared.ts`. No `OPENCLAW_TOOLS_PROFILE` env var exists. Four built-in profiles: `minimal`, `coding`, `messaging`, `full`. For subprocess invocation, use system-prompt-level restriction + post-run audit |\n| **`--max-tokens` flag** (Task 0.3) | Does not exist in `openclaw agent` | Enforce post-run via `meta.agentMeta.usage.total` from `--json` output |\n| **`--max-tool-calls` flag** (Task 0.3) | Does not exist in `openclaw agent` | `meta.pendingToolCalls` array available in `--json` output for end-of-run pending calls; for full count, parse session JSONL transcript |\n\n| **`--timeout` flag** (Task 0.3) | ✅ Exists (`src/cli/program/register.agent.ts:46-48`) | Maps directly to `workflowTimeoutMinutes` |\n| **`--json` output** (Task 4.1) | ✅ Provides `meta.agentMeta.usage` with `input`, `output`, `cacheRead`, `cacheWrite`, `total`; also `meta.durationMs`, `meta.stopReason`, `meta.error`, `meta.pendingToolCalls`, `meta.agentMeta.provider`, `meta.agentMeta.model`, `meta.agentMeta.sessionId` | Token tracking and run manifest population fully supported |\n| **`--local` flag** | ✅ Exists (`src/cli/program/register.agent.ts:40-42`) | Embedded agent execution verified by existing `.GITOPENCLAW/lifecycle/GITOPENCLAW-AGENT.ts` which uses `--local` in production workflow runs |\n| **`--session-id` flag** | ✅ Exists | Session continuity across workflow runs works |\n| **OAuth Device Flow** (Task 2.4) | ✅ Feasible but unusual for web apps | UX involves showing a code + `github.com/login/device` — document clearly |\n| **`repository_dispatch`** (Task 5.2) | ✅ Supported by GitHub Actions | Cross-repo replies need PAT or callback dispatch pattern |\n| **GitHub Actions timeout** (Task 0.3) | ✅ Max 360 minutes (6 hours) for hosted runners | Correctly specified |\n| **GitHub API rate limit** | `GITHUB_TOKEN`: 1000 req/hr/repo; OAuth: 5000 req/hr ([docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/rate-limit)) | Document in Task 2.6 polling strategy |\n| **GitHub Pages** (Phase 2) | ✅ Fully supported | Requires repo settings enablement (documented in Task 3.3) |\n| **CLI command introspection** (Task 3.1) | Commander tree not directly importable | Use `openclaw --help` parsing approach (recommended) |\n| **Bun availability** (Task 3.3) | Not universally installed | Added npm fallback detection |\n\nAll 16 tasks are **confirmed feasible** with the corrections noted above applied to each task's AI Request.\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Execution Order\n\n```\nPhase 0 (Foundation — Security & Reliability)                     writes → .GITOPENCLAW/ only\n  0.1  Settings Schema & Preflight Validation                       ✅ boundary-safe — VERIFIED feasible\n  0.2  Trust-Level Gating                                           ✅ boundary-safe — CORRECTED (system-prompt restriction + post-run audit, not --tools flag or env var)\n  0.3  Cost and Resource Boundaries                                 ✅ boundary-safe — CORRECTED (post-run enforcement via --json output + session JSONL parsing)\n  ─── 🔭 First Light: Issue Processing (agent can securely process Issues end-to-end) ───\n\nPhase 1 (Issue Chat Completeness)                                 writes → .GITOPENCLAW/ only\n  1.1  Slash Command Parser                                         ✅ boundary-safe — VERIFIED feasible\n  1.2  /help Command and Command Reference                          ✅ boundary-safe\n  1.3  Rich Markdown Output Templates                               ✅ boundary-safe\n  1.4  Machine-Readable Command Policy                              ✅ boundary-safe\n  1.5  Onboarding Wizard via Multi-Turn Issue Thread                ✅ boundary-safe\n\nPhase 2 (GitHub Pages Dashboard)                                  writes → .GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/\n  2.1  Backend Adapter Interface                                    ✅ .GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/\n  2.2  GitHub API Adapter                                           ✅ .GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/\n  2.3  Vite Build Configuration for Pages                           ✅ .GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/\n  2.4  GitHub OAuth Authentication Flow                             ✅ .GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/ — CLARIFIED (Device Flow UX documented)\n  2.5  GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow                              ⚙️ template in .GITOPENCLAW/install/\n  2.6  Chat View Backed by Issues API                               ✅ .GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/\n\nPhase 3 (Auto-Morphing Pipeline)                                  writes → .GITOPENCLAW/ only\n  3.1  CLI Command Introspection & Registry Generation              ✅ .GITOPENCLAW/scripts/ → .GITOPENCLAW/config/ — CORRECTED (--help parsing)\n  3.2  Config Schema → Form Auto-Generation                         ✅ .GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/\n  3.3  One-Command Setup Script (installer)                         ⚙️ sole sanctioned boundary-crossing write — IMPROVED (npm fallback)\n\nPhase 4 (Observability & Resilience)                              writes → .GITOPENCLAW/ only\n  4.1  Structured Audit Trail (Run Manifests)                       ✅ boundary-safe — CORRECTED (aligned with --json output schema)\n  4.2  Drift Detection and Health Check Workflow                    ⚙️ template in .GITOPENCLAW/install/\n\nPhase 5 (Multi-Entity Collaboration)                              writes → .GITOPENCLAW/ only\n  5.1  Entity Identity Manifest                                     ✅ boundary-safe\n  5.2  Cross-Repo Dispatch Handler                                  ⚙️ template in .GITOPENCLAW/install/ — CLARIFIED (PAT/callback options)\n  5.3  Collaboration Policy UI in Pages Dashboard                   ✅ .GITOPENCLAW/dashboard/\n```\n\nLegend: ✅ = writes only within `.GITOPENCLAW/`; ⚙️ = template-then-install pattern (installer copies to `.github/`).\n\n**Total: 16 tasks across 6 phases. All verified feasible.**\n\nEvery task respects the Write Boundary Principle. Tasks marked ⚙️ use the template-then-install pattern: source-of-truth lives in `.GITOPENCLAW/install/`, and the installer (Task 3.3) is the sole sanctioned mechanism for writing files outside `.GITOPENCLAW/`.\n\nEach AI request is self-contained and can be issued as-is to a coding agent. Tasks within a phase can be parallelized where dependencies allow (e.g., Tasks 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 can run in parallel after Task 1.1 completes).\n\n**Feasibility audit (2026-03-01):** All 16 tasks have been verified against the actual OpenClaw CLI source code (`src/cli/program/`, `src/commands/agent/`, `src/agents/`) and GitHub platform documentation. Tasks 0.2, 0.3, 3.1, and 4.1 contained references to non-existent CLI flags and have been corrected to use verified alternatives. Tasks 2.4 and 5.2 had feasibility caveats that are now explicitly documented. No tasks were removed — all are implementable.\n\n---\n\n*Generated from `.ANALYSIS-OPENCLAW-FUNCTIONALITY-EQUIVALENTS.md`, `.ANALYSIS-GIT-ENHANCEMENTS.md`, and `.ANALYSIS-GITHUB-VS-GIT.md`.
