# .GITCLAW Help Lens

### A translation layer from CLI help documentation to the GitHub Issues UX

---

## What This Is

OpenClaw's existing help documentation (`docs/cli/`, `docs/help/`) is written for the terminal — `openclaw <command> [options]`. When the agent lives inside a GitHub repository via `.GITOPENCLAW` (or `.GITCLAW`), the UX surface is **GitHub Issues**, not a shell. Users type comments, not commands.

This document is the **help lens**: a wrapper that maps every CLI help page to its GitHub Issues equivalent, with concrete examples a user can copy-paste into an issue comment and get a useful response.

The lens serves three purposes:

1. **For users** — "I read the CLI docs; how do I do the same thing in an issue?"
2. **For the agent** — a reference the agent can consult to translate `/command` requests into the right internal operations
3. **For contributors** — a checklist of what is covered and what still needs implementation in the GitHub Issues UX

---

## Design Principles

| Principle | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Natural language first** | Issue comments are freeform text. Users should be able to ask in plain English and get results. `/commands` are shortcuts, not requirements. |
| **`/command` as accelerator** | Structured `/command arg` syntax provides precision when the user wants it. The agent recognizes both natural language and `/command` prefixes. |
| **Markdown output** | Every response renders as a GitHub-flavored Markdown comment: tables, code blocks, collapsible sections, task lists, and linked references. |
| **Progressive disclosure** | Simple asks get simple answers. Append `--verbose` or ask "show me details" for the deep dive. |
| **Commit as side effect** | Commands that mutate state (config, memory, sessions) commit changes to `.GITOPENCLAW/state/` and link the commit in the response. |

---

## Quick Reference Card

Copy any of these into an issue comment to invoke the equivalent CLI command:

### Agent & Messaging

| What you want | Issue comment |
|---|---|
| Talk to the agent | Just write your message — every comment is an agent turn |
| Send a message to another channel | `/send slack #general "deploy finished"` |
| Send to a specific contact | `/send telegram @alice "PR is ready for review"` |
| Route a reply elsewhere | `/reply-to discord #alerts` |

**CLI equivalent:** `openclaw agent --message "..."`, `openclaw message send --channel slack --target "#general" --body "deploy finished"`

### Configuration

| What you want | Issue comment |
|---|---|
| View a config value | `/config get defaultModel` |
| Change the model | `/config set defaultModel claude-sonnet-4-20250514` |
| Change the provider | `/config set defaultProvider openai` |
| Change thinking level | `/config set defaultThinkingLevel medium` |
| Show full config | `/config list` |

**CLI equivalent:** `openclaw config get <path>`, `openclaw config set <path> <value>`

### Status & Health

| What you want | Issue comment |
|---|---|
| Quick status check | `/status` |
| Full diagnostic | `/doctor` |
| Check what version is running | `/version` |

**CLI equivalent:** `openclaw status`, `openclaw doctor`, `openclaw --version`

### Sessions & Memory

| What you want | Issue comment |
|---|---|
| List recent sessions | `/sessions list` |
| Search memory | `/memory search "database optimization"` |
| Show memory status | `/memory status` |

**CLI equivalent:** `openclaw sessions`, `openclaw memory search "database optimization"`, `openclaw memory status`

### Models & Providers

| What you want | Issue comment |
|---|---|
| List available models | `/models list` |
| Change default model | `/models set gpt-4o` |
| Check provider auth | `/models status` |

**CLI equivalent:** `openclaw models list`, `openclaw models set gpt-4o`, `openclaw models status`

### Channels

| What you want | Issue comment |
|---|---|
| List connected channels | `/channels list` |
| Check channel health | `/channels status` |

**CLI equivalent:** `openclaw channels list`, `openclaw channels status`

### Skills & Plugins

| What you want | Issue comment |
|---|---|
| List available skills | `/skills list` |
| Check skill eligibility | `/skills check` |
| List plugins | `/plugins list` |

**CLI equivalent:** `openclaw skills list`, `openclaw skills check`, `openclaw plugins list`

### Cron & Scheduled Tasks

| What you want | Issue comment |
|---|---|
| List scheduled jobs | `/cron list` |
| Create a daily job | `/cron create "morning triage" "0 9 * * *" "Summarize open PRs"` |
| Run a job now | `/cron run <job-id>` |

**CLI equivalent:** `openclaw cron list`, `openclaw cron create ...`, `openclaw cron run <id>`

### Updates

| What you want | Issue comment |
|---|---|
| Check for updates | `/update status` |
| Update the agent | `/update` |

**CLI equivalent:** `openclaw update status`, `openclaw update`

---

## Detailed Command Mapping

Each section below maps a CLI help page (`docs/cli/<command>.md`) to its GitHub Issues equivalent with worked examples.

### `agent` → Direct conversation

**CLI:** `openclaw agent --message "summarize the logs" --thinking medium`

**Issue comment:**
> Summarize the logs

Or with explicit control:
> `/agent --thinking medium summarize the logs`

Every issue comment **is** an agent turn. The agent reads the comment, thinks, and replies. No `/agent` prefix is needed for the common case — just write your message.

For multi-turn conversations, keep commenting on the same issue. The agent resumes the session automatically via the issue-to-session mapping in `state/issues/<n>.json`.

---

### `config` → `/config`

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw config get defaultModel
openclaw config set defaultProvider openai
openclaw config unset tools.web.search.apiKey
```

**Issue comments:**
> `/config get defaultModel`
>
> `/config set defaultProvider openai`
>
> `/config set defaultModel gpt-4o`

The agent reads from or writes to `.GITOPENCLAW/config/settings.json`, commits the change, and replies with the updated value. A link to the commit is included in the response.

---

### `status` → `/status`

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw status
openclaw status --all
openclaw status --deep
```

**Issue comments:**
> `/status`
>
> `/status --deep`
>
> What's the current status?

The agent compiles a Markdown table with configuration state, channel health, and recent session activity.

---

### `doctor` → `/doctor`

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw doctor
openclaw doctor --repair
openclaw doctor --deep
```

**Issue comments:**
> `/doctor`
>
> `/doctor --deep`
>
> Something seems broken, can you run diagnostics?

The agent runs health checks on configuration integrity, state directory health, and dependency status. Findings are posted as a structured Markdown checklist with ✅/❌ indicators.

---

### `memory` → `/memory`

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw memory status
openclaw memory search "release checklist"
openclaw memory index
```

**Issue comments:**
> `/memory status`
>
> `/memory search release checklist`
>
> Search your memory for anything about database optimization

Results are returned as a Markdown table or list with relevance scores and source references.

---

### `sessions` → `/sessions`

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw sessions
openclaw sessions --all-agents
openclaw sessions --json
```

**Issue comments:**
> `/sessions list`
>
> How many conversations have we had?

The agent reads `state/sessions/` and returns a summary table with session IDs, timestamps, message counts, and linked issue numbers.

---

### `models` → `/models`

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw models list
openclaw models set claude-sonnet-4-20250514
openclaw models status
```

**Issue comments:**
> `/models list`
>
> `/models set gpt-4o`
>
> What model are you using?

Model changes update `config/settings.json` and take effect on the next agent turn.

---

### `channels` → `/channels`

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw channels list
openclaw channels status
openclaw channels add --channel telegram --token <token>
```

**Issue comments:**
> `/channels list`
>
> `/channels status`
>
> What channels are connected?

Note: `channels add` requires secrets (API tokens) which cannot be posted in issue comments. For channel setup, the agent will guide the user to add secrets via **Repository Settings → Secrets** and then confirm setup via a follow-up comment.

---

### `skills` → `/skills`

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw skills list
openclaw skills list --eligible
openclaw skills info code-review
openclaw skills check
```

**Issue comments:**
> `/skills list`
>
> `/skills check`
>
> What skills do you have?

---

### `plugins` → `/plugins`

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw plugins list
openclaw plugins enable memory-lancedb
openclaw plugins doctor
```

**Issue comments:**
> `/plugins list`
>
> `/plugins doctor`
>
> What plugins are installed?

Plugin installation modifies `package.json` and requires a dependency install cycle. The agent commits the change and the next workflow run picks up the new plugin.

---

### `cron` → `/cron`

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw cron list
openclaw cron create "daily triage" "0 9 * * *"
openclaw cron run <job-id>
```

**Issue comments:**
> `/cron list`
>
> `/cron create "morning standup" "0 9 * * 1-5" "Summarize yesterday's merged PRs"`
>
> Run the daily triage job now

Cron jobs in the GitHub Issues context translate to GitHub Actions scheduled workflows. The agent creates or modifies workflow schedules and commits them.

---

### `message` → `/send`

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw message send --channel slack --target "#general" --body "deploy complete"
openclaw message send --channel telegram --target "@alice" --body "PR merged"
```

**Issue comments:**
> `/send slack #general "deploy complete"`
>
> `/send telegram @alice "PR merged"`
>
> Send a message to the #alerts channel on Discord saying the build passed

Outbound messaging requires the target channel to be configured and authenticated.

---

### `onboard` → Open a new issue

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw onboard
openclaw onboard --flow quickstart
```

**Issue equivalent:**

Open a new issue titled **"Setup OpenClaw"** or use the hatch issue template. The agent runs interactive onboarding via a multi-comment conversation, asking for provider preference, model selection, and configuration choices.

---

### `update` → `/update`

**CLI:**
```bash
openclaw update
openclaw update status
openclaw update --channel beta
```

**Issue comments:**
> `/update status`
>
> `/update`
>
> Is there a newer version available?

The agent checks the upstream version, updates `package.json` if needed, and commits the change.

---

### `gateway` → Not directly applicable

The Gateway (`openclaw gateway run`) is a persistent WebSocket server. In the `.GITCLAW` model, GitHub Actions **is** the compute layer — there is no long-running gateway process. Gateway-specific commands (`gateway start`, `gateway run`, `gateway status`) do not have direct Issue equivalents.

What the Gateway provides is decomposed into:
- **Agent execution** → each issue comment triggers a GitHub Actions workflow
- **Channel routing** → `/send` commands for outbound messages
- **Session persistence** → git-committed JSONL files
- **Health monitoring** → `/status` and `/doctor`

---

## Natural Language Examples

Users do not need to memorize `/commands`. The agent understands natural language requests and maps them to the appropriate action:

| Natural language request | What the agent does |
|---|---|
| "What model are you using?" | Reads `config/settings.json` and replies with the model name |
| "Switch to GPT-4o" | Runs `/models set gpt-4o` internally |
| "Show me recent conversations" | Runs `/sessions list` internally |
| "Search your memory for authentication bugs" | Runs `/memory search "authentication bugs"` internally |
| "Run diagnostics" | Runs `/doctor` internally |
| "What's your status?" | Runs `/status` internally |
| "Tell the team on Slack that the release is out" | Runs `/send slack #general "the release is out"` internally |
| "What skills do you have?" | Runs `/skills list` internally |
| "Create a daily job to check for stale PRs" | Runs `/cron create "stale PR check" "0 9 * * *" "List PRs with no activity in 7 days"` internally |
| "Are there any updates available?" | Runs `/update status` internally |
| "Change your thinking level to low" | Runs `/config set defaultThinkingLevel low` internally |

---

## What Does Not Translate

Some CLI commands are inherently local or require persistent infrastructure that GitHub Actions cannot provide:

| CLI Command | Why it does not translate | Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| `openclaw gateway run` | Requires a persistent process | GitHub Actions is the compute; no gateway needed |
| `openclaw gateway start` | Same as above | N/A |
| `openclaw tui` | Terminal UI requires a TTY | Use the issue thread as the conversational interface |
| `openclaw browser` | Requires a headed browser session | Agent has access to web tools within the Actions runner |
| `openclaw daemon` | System service management | GitHub Actions manages lifecycle |
| `openclaw qr` | Generates terminal QR codes for pairing | Not applicable; no local device pairing in Issues UX |
| `openclaw pairing` | Device-to-device pairing | Not applicable in the Issues context |
| `openclaw nodes` / `openclaw devices` | Multi-device mesh management | Single-node execution on Actions runner |
| `openclaw configure` | Interactive terminal wizard | Use `/config set` commands or open a "Setup" issue for guided onboarding |
| `openclaw sandbox` | Container sandbox management | Actions runner is the sandbox |
| `openclaw reset` | Destructive state reset | Ask the agent: "Reset your state" — scoped to `.GITOPENCLAW/state/` |
| `openclaw uninstall` | Remove OpenClaw from the system | Delete the `.GITOPENCLAW/` folder and its workflow |

---

## Response Format Guidelines

When the agent responds to `/commands` in the Issues UX, the output should follow these formatting conventions to match what users expect from the CLI but adapted for Markdown:

| CLI Output | Issue Comment Output |
|---|---|
| ANSI-colored table | Markdown table |
| Progress spinner | 👀 reaction during processing → ✅ on completion |
| Code block output | Fenced code block with language hint |
| Error with exit code | ❌ callout block with error description and remediation |
| Interactive prompt | Follow-up question in a comment; user replies to continue |
| JSON output (`--json`) | Fenced JSON code block with collapsible `<details>` wrapper for large payloads |
| Streaming response | Single complete comment (no partial updates) |
| File output | Committed to repo with a link to the commit |
| Hyperlinks (OSC-8) | Standard Markdown links |

---

## Implementation Notes

For contributors implementing `/command` support in the agent orchestrator:

1. **Command parsing**: The orchestrator (`GITOPENCLAW-AGENT.ts`) receives the full comment body. A prefix parser detects `/command` patterns and extracts the command name and arguments. See the equivalence map in `.ANALYSIS-OPENCLAW-FUNCTIONALITY-EQUIVALENTS.md` §2.2 for the canonical mapping.

2. **Fallback to natural language**: If no `/command` prefix is detected, the full comment is passed to the agent as a natural language message. The agent's system prompt includes awareness of these commands and can invoke them internally.

3. **State mutations are commits**: Any command that changes configuration or state must `git add .GITOPENCLAW/` → `git commit` → `git push` before replying. The commit SHA should be included in the response.

4. **Secrets are never in comments**: Commands requiring credentials (channel tokens, API keys) must redirect the user to GitHub's **Repository Settings → Secrets** UI. The agent must never ask for or accept secrets in issue comments.

5. **Output truncation**: GitHub has a ~65,536 character limit on issue comments. Large outputs (session dumps, memory searches with many results) should use `<details>` collapsible sections or pagination ("showing 10 of 47 results — reply `/more` for the next page").

6. **Help command**: `/help` or "What can you do?" should return a compact version of the Quick Reference Card above, tailored to the commands actually implemented.
